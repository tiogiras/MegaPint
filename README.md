## What is MegaPint?

**MegaPint** is a collection of **Editor Tools for the Unity Engine**.  
Its primary goal is to **streamline and enhance your workflow inside the Unity Editor**, so you can focus more on creating and less on repetitive tasks.

## What is this Package?

This repository contains the **base package** of the MegaPint collection.  
It acts as a **hub** for all other MegaPint tools by:

- Providing a shared foundation for common functionality  
- Simplifying the installation and management of additional tools  
- Ensuring compatibility across the entire MegaPint ecosystem  

⚠️ **Important:** None of the other MegaPint packages will function without this **base package** installed.
